\section{Methodology}\label{sec:method}

This section describes some of the theory and methods involved in this work. The governing equations of the numerical model are discussed in section \ref{subsec:LTE}. We then provide analytical expressions for the degree-2 tidal potential in section \ref{subsec:pot}. Following this, descriptions of the discretisation and numerical scheme are outlined in section \ref{subsec:model}, with a summary of our simulations ran in section \ref{subsec:param}.

\subsection{Laplace Tidal Equations \label{subsec:LTE}}

The equations of motion and continuity that describe ocean flow in the shallow water limit are known as the Laplace Tidal Equations (LTEs) \citep{lamb1932hydrodynamics}. The main assumption leading to this set of equations is that radial (vertical) ocean flow is negligible when compared to lateral flow, reducing the problem to two dimensions. This is indeed a good approximation at the planetary scale, where lateral flow length scales span much greater distances than the depth of the ocean. The conservation of mass (eq. \ref{eq:mass}) and momentum (eq. \ref{eq:mom}) that make up the LTEs, including both Rayleigh and bottom drag, are given as \citep{sears1995tidal,tyler2008strong,matsuyama2014tidal}:

\begin{gather}
\partial_t \eta + \nabla \cdot \left(h \bm{u}\right) = 0\, , \label{eq:mass}\\
\begin{aligned} 
\partial_t \bm{u} + 2 \bm{\Omega} \times \bm{u} + \alpha\bm{u} + \frac{c_D}{h} \left|\bm{u}\right| \bm{u}  + g \nabla \eta \\ = (1 + k_2 - h_2) \nabla U_2 \, . \label{eq:mom}\\
\end{aligned} 
\end{gather}

Equation \ref{eq:mass} consists of two terms. The first is the time rate of change of vertical sea surface displacement, $\eta$, about some equilibrium level, $h_0$, where the total ocean thickness, $h = h_0 + \eta$. The second term is the divergence of the ocean depth multiplied by the surface velocity vector, $\bm{u} \equiv (u, v)$, where $u$ and $v$ are the eastward and northward velocity components, respectively. This divergence term is required to conserve mass.

The term on the right hand side of Equation \ref{eq:mom} is an applied force per unit mass. $\nabla U_2$ is the gradient of the degree-2 tide raising potential, discussed in section \ref{subsec:pot}. It is multiplied by Love's reduction factor, $1 + k_2 - h_2$. Love's first number, $k_2$, is a proportionality constant accounting for the additional tidal potential due to the elastic redistribution of mass on the satellite. $h_2$, the second Love number, accounts for the tidal potential arising from solid body surface displacement of the satellite \citep{love1911some}.

The time derivative of velocity is the first term on the left hand side of the momentum equation (eq. \ref{eq:mom}). It is balanced by four force per unit mass terms on the left hand side. The first of these terms is the coriolis acceleration, where $\bm{\Omega}$ is the satellite's rotational angular velocity vector. Rayleigh and bottom drag are described in the next two terms, where $\alpha$ and $c_D$ are the Rayleigh (linear) and bottom (quadratic) drag coefficients, respectively \citep{sears1995tidal,chen2013tidal}. The last term on the left hand side of Equation \ref{eq:mom} is the gravitational restoring acceleration per unit mass. It acts to restore changes in sea surface displacement about the undisturbed ocean depth, $h_0$.

\subsection{Tidal Potential \label{subsec:pot}}

Finite eccentricity and obliquity cause libration of the satellite's tidal bulge in longitude and latitude, respectively \citep{tyler2011tidal}. It is this libration that primarily induces ocean flow. We therefore find it convenient to split the full degree two tidal potential into two main components, the eccentricity and obliquity tides:
\begin{align}
U_2 &= U_{ecc} + U_{obliq}\, . \label{eq:U_2}
\end{align}
To first order in eccentricity and obliquity, the two primary tidal components can be expressed as \citep{tobie2005tidal,tyler2011tidal,matsuyama2014tidal},
\begin{multline}
U_{ecc} = \Omega^2 r^2 e \left\lbrace - \frac{3}{2} P_{20}\left(\cos\theta\right) \cos \left(\Omega t \right) + \frac{1}{8} P_{22}\left( \cos\theta\right) \right. \\ 
\times \left. \vphantom{\frac{1}{8}} \left[7 \cos \left(2 \phi - \Omega t \right) - \cos \left(2 \phi + \Omega t\right) \right] \right\rbrace, \label{eq:U_ecc}
\end{multline} and,
\begin{multline}
U_{obliq} = \frac{1}{2}\Omega^2 r^2 \theta_0 P_{21}\left(\cos\theta\right)\\
\times \left[ \cos \left(\phi - \Omega t \right) - \cos \left( \phi + \Omega t\right) \right] \, ,\label{eq:U_obliq}
\end{multline}
where $r$ is the satellite's radius, $e$ is its eccentricity, and $\theta_0$ is the obliquity in radians. Co-latitude and longitude are given as $\theta$ and $\phi$ respectively. $P_{lm}$ represents the associated Legendre function of degree $l$ and order $m$. The eccentricity tide can be further split into the two terms on the right hand side of Equation \ref{eq:U_ecc}. These terms represent the eccentricity-radial ($U_{20}$) and eccentricity-libration ($U_{22}$) tides respectively, as described by \citet{tyler2011tidal}. We can therefore rewrite equation \ref{eq:U_2} as $U_2 = U_{20} + U_{21} + U_{22}$.

The derivatives of equations \ref{eq:U_ecc} and \ref{eq:U_obliq}, required to solve the LTE, are given in the appendix.

Both $u$ and $v$ are defined at the cell walls. Lines of meridian merge to singularities at the poles, where a single $\eta$ and multiple $u$ nodes are stored.\label{fig:grid}}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Tidal Quality Factor}

A useful parameter for understanding tidal dissipation is the quality factor, $Q$. Defined as the ratio of maximum energy stored to the total energy dissipated in an elastic, small values of $Q$ correspond to a dissipative environment \citep{goldreich1966q}. \citet{tyler2011tidal} and \citet{matsuyama2014tidal}, however, use the kinetic energy $E_k$ of the fluid system to represent the energy stored in the tide;
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Q}
Q \equiv 2 \pi \dfrac{\text{max} \left( E_{k} \right)}{E_{diss}} = \dfrac{\Omega}{2 \alpha}
\end{equation}

where the total time averaged dissipation is $E_{diss}$. This definition is ill-defined, however, as the the kinetic and dissipated energy in the ocean tide are intrinsically coupled. Large drag coefficients enhance dissipation, but this demands a decrease in the kinetic energy of the system. This coupling makes it difficult to use a definition of $Q$ that is meaningful to the Planetary Science community. We suggest that a more appropriate definition would be using the maximum stored energy in the equilibrium tide (i.e., the theoretical instantaneous tide raised in the absence of dissipation) in the numerator of Equation \ref{eq:Q}, which is used in dissipation studies of the gas planets \citep{goldreich1966q}. For the remainder of this work, however, we return to simply presenting our results as a function of drag coefficient, rather than potentially misleading readers with alternate definitions of $Q$. 

\subsection{Numerical Model \label{subsec:model}}

In this section we outline our two dimensional, finite difference computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, known as Ocean Dissipation in Icy Satellites (ODIS). In its current form, ODIS is based extensively on the models discussed in and developed by \citet{zahel1973diurnalk,zahel1978influence} and \citet{sears1994tidal,sears1995tidal}. We first provide a description of the numerical grid. An overview of the finite difference scheme itself is the given, before summarising and illustrating limitations of the finite difference scheme and grid choice.

\subsubsection{Discretized Grid \label{subsec:grid}}



We employ a fixed latitude-longitude grid for our numerical simulations, defined in a spherical coordinate system. The grid is constructed in a staggered manner, meaning that velocity nodes are placed to the east and south of their parent displacement nodes. This is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:grid}, where we define $u$ and $v$ as the eastward and northward velocity components, respectively. $\Delta \lambda$ is the grid spacing in latitude, whereas $\Delta \phi$ is the grid spacing in longitude. A staggered approach is adopted as it avoids numerical oscillations that grow in the solution by calculating derivatives \textit{between} grid nodes rather than over them. This is discussed further in section \ref{subsec:fd_expan}.

As is clear from Figure \ref{fig:grid}, lines of meridian all converge to single points at either pole. Consequently, the model is forced to go from $m$ longitudinal grid points immediately surrounding the pole to merely a single point at the pole itself. Accordingly, single values of $\eta$ are stored at each pole, whereas multiple $u$ values are required to maintain numerical stability. 

ODIS stores three separate 2D arrays for $\eta$, $u$ and $v$. They are accessed in a parent-child configuration, whereby the velocity nodes immediately east and south of a displacement node are the children to their parent $\eta$. Both $u$ and $v$ at the southern and eastern walls of the cell in Figure \ref{fig:grid} are children to the central $\eta$ node. % This is of little importance to the model's computations, but does lend some insight into the infrastructure of ODIS.

\subsubsection{Finite Difference Expansions \label{subsec:fd_expan}}

In order to solve the LTEs, we expand equations \ref{eq:mass} and \ref{eq:mom} in a semi-implicit finite difference scheme in spherical coordinates \citep{sears1995tidal}. Expanding $\bm{u}$ into its components and assuming $\eta \ll h$, the momentum equation becomes,

\vspace{-0.6cm}
\begin{multline}
u_{ij}^{t+1} \approx  \left[ \,2 \Omega \bar{v}_{ij} \sin{\lambda_i} \vphantom{\frac{c_D}{h_0}\sqrt{\left(u_{ij}^{t}\right)^2}} - \alpha u_{ij}^{t} \right. \\ 
- \frac{c_D}{h}\sqrt{\left(u_{ij}^{t}\right)^2 + \left(\bar{v}_{ij}^{t}\right)^2}\cdot\left(u_{ij}^{t}\right)^2 - \frac{g}{R \cos{\lambda_i}} \frac{\partial \eta_{ij}^{t}}{\partial \phi_j} \\  
+ \left.\left(1 + k_2 - h_2\right) \frac{1}{R \cos{\lambda_i}} \frac{\partial U_{2,ij}^{t}}{\partial \phi_j} \right]  \Delta t + u_{ij}^{t} \, , \label{eq:momu_fd}
\end{multline}
\vspace{-0.6cm}
\begin{multline}
v_{ij}^{t+1} \approx  \left[ \,-2 \Omega \bar{u}_{ij} \sin{\lambda_i} \vphantom{\frac{c_D}{h}\sqrt{\left(u_{ij}^{t}\right)^2}} - \alpha v_{ij}^{t} \right. \\ 
- \frac{c_D}{h_0}\sqrt{\left(\bar{u}_{ij}^{t}\right)^2 + \left(v_{ij}^{t}\right)^2}\cdot\left(v_{ij}^{t}\right)^2 - \frac{g}{R} \frac{\partial \eta_{ij}^{t}}{\partial \lambda_i} \\  
+ \left.\left(1 + k_2 - h_2\right) \frac{1}{R} \frac{\partial U_{2,ij}^{t}}{\partial \lambda_i} \right]  \Delta t + v_{ij}^{t} \, , \label{eq:momv_fd}
\end{multline}

\noindent and the continuity equation becomes, 
\begin{equation}
\eta_{ij}^{t+1} \approx 
-\frac{h_0}{R \cos{\lambda_i}}\left(
\frac{\partial \left(v_{ij}^{t+1} \cos{\lambda_i}\right)}{\partial	\lambda_i}  
+\frac{\partial u_{ij}^{t+1}}{\partial	\phi_j}\right)
\Delta t
+ \eta_{ij}^{t}\, . \label{eq:mass_fd}
\end{equation}

Latitude and longitude are denoted by $\lambda$ and $\phi$ respectively. $i$ and $j$ represent the $i\text{th}$ and $j\text{th}$ latitude and longitude nodes within the grid. The time index is given by $t$, and $\Delta t$ represents the time-step. Overbars correspond to spatial averages, a necessity given the staggered nature of the grid. These expansions are made using the Euler method, and as such are first order accurate in space and time.

All derivatives of the degree-2 tidal potential (equations \ref{eq:U_ecc} and \ref{eq:U_obliq}) have analytical solutions, and thus do not require further finite difference expansions (see appendix). Derivatives of all other quantities, however, do require further expansion. The expansions take the general form of either,
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial w_{ij}}{\partial \lambda} &\approx \frac{w_{i+\nicefrac{1}{2},j} - w_{i-\nicefrac{1}{2},j}}{\Delta \lambda} \, , \label{eq:gen1}
\shortintertext{or, }
\frac{\partial w_{ij}}{\partial \phi} &\approx \frac{w_{i,j+\nicefrac{1}{2}} - w_{i,j-\nicefrac{1}{2}}}{\Delta \phi} \, , \label{eq:gen2}
\end{align}

\noindent where $w$ represents $u$, $v$ or $\eta$.

Equations \ref{eq:gen1} and \ref{eq:gen2} show that each derivative is evaluated halfway between the nodes where $w$ is stored. Consequently, any derivative of $w$ is calculated at a position held by a different variable because the grid is staggered. For example, $\partial_\phi u_{ij}$ is always evaluated at the position held by $\eta_{ij}$ as $u_{i,j-\nicefrac{1}{2}}$ and $u_{i,j+\nicefrac{1}{2}}$ lie to the left and right of $\eta_{ij}$,  respectively. This is shown clearly on the right of Figure \ref{fig:grid}.

\subsubsection{Numerical Scheme}

ODIS begins its calculations by (1) determining the mass of each volume element in the initial ocean assuming an undisturbed ocean of depth $h_0$. With the mass calculated in each cell, it is then possible to find the dissipated energy in the system.

The next step in the numerical integration is to calculate $\nabla U_2$ across all $u$ and $v$ grid points (2). This gives the initial force per unit mass experienced by a fluid element in the model domain.

Once the tidal acceleration is known, ODIS directly calculates $u$ and $v$ over the grid by solving equations \ref{eq:momu_fd} and \ref{eq:momv_fd} (3). This step is purely explicit as $u$ and $v$ depend only on information from the previous time step, $t$. Following this, $\eta$ is then updated using the new velocity values (4). In contrast to the velocity calculations, this step is semi-implicit as it relies on values from both the current and previous time steps, as shown in Equation \ref{eq:mass_fd} \citep{sears1995tidal}.

After solutions for $u$, $v$, and $\eta$ are found at the new time step, $t+1$, the energy calculations begin (5). For Rayleigh drag, ODIS calculates and stores global dissipated energy flux as,
\begin{equation}
F_{\alpha}^{t+1} = \frac{1}{4 \pi R^2 }\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{m} \alpha M_{ij} \left[\left(u_{ij}^{t+1}\right)^2 + \left(v_{ij}^{t+1}\right)^2\right] \, , \label{eq:E_alpha}
\end{equation}

for $n$ and $m$ grid points in latitude and longitude, respectively. 

The summed terms in Equation \ref{eq:E_alpha} give the total dissipated energy in the system across the current time step, for each cell of mass $M$. The factor in front of the summations then averages this quantity over the satellite's surface area giving $F_{\alpha}$ in watts per square metre. For bottom drag the equivalent expression is
\begin{equation}
F_{c_D}^{t+1} = \frac{1}{4 \pi h_0 R^2 }\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{m} c_D M_{ij} \left[\left(u_{ij}^{t+1}\right)^2 + \left(v_{ij}^{t+1}\right)^2\right]^{\nicefrac{3}{2}}\, . \label{eq:E_cd}
\end{equation}
Details of these derivations are discussed in the appendix.

Every time step calculations 2-5 are repeated, beginning from determining $\nabla U_2$. Finally, at the end of each orbit, $F_\alpha$ or $F_{c_D}$ is summed and averaged over the orbital period (6). This gives the time and surface averaged heat flux due to tidal dissipation for Rayleigh drag,
\begin{align}
\left\langle F_\alpha \right\rangle_{orbit} &= \frac{1}{p}\sum_{t=1}^{p} F_{\alpha}^{t}  \, , \label{eq:E_alpha_orbit}
\shortintertext{and bottom drag,}
\left\langle F_{c_D} \right\rangle_{orbit} &= \frac{1}{p}\sum_{t=1}^{p} F_{c_D}^{t}  \, , \label{eq:E_cd_orbit}
\end{align}

where $p = \nicefrac{T}{\Delta t}$, the total number of time steps in the orbital period, $T$. These expressions are consistent with \citep{sears1995tidal}.

These simulations are for the obliquity tide using $h = \SI{1}{\kilo\metre}$ and $\alpha = \SI{e-8}{\per\second}$ on Titan. \label{fig:conv}}
\end{figure}

Steps 2-6 are repeated until the model has converged into a periodic equilibrium. Care must be taken when selecting convergence criteria. Simulations involving deep oceans and small drag coefficients will oscillate about their converged solution with periods of 10 - 100 orbits due to the large inertia associated with deep, poorly dissipative oceans (see Figure \ref{fig:conv_a}). These simulations clearly require longer run-time. For the most time consuming simulations, we take the mean dissipation over one full oscillatory cycle.


\subsubsection{Grid Limitations and Resolution Testing \label{subsubsec:grid_lim}}

As with any numerical solution there are errors associated with discretization of the problem into the model domain. We performed resolution testing across various ocean depths to determine how these errors scale with grid resolution. One of these tests is shown in Figure \ref{fig:conv}. The upper plot shows how the numerical time-averaged dissipated energy solution converges to a final value. As grid resolution is increased the numerical estimate converges to the analytically derived solution. The lower plot shows the numerical error as a function of increasing resolution, indicating first to second order convergence in the numerical solution. Based on these resolution tests, all further simulations were ran for grid spacings of \SIrange{1}{3}{\degree} in latitude and longitude. 

A natural issue arising from the choice of grid is the time step used. As described in section \ref{subsec:grid}, the fixed latitude-longitude grid causes meridian lines to converge at the poles. Nodes near each pole therefore have much smaller spatial separations than those at the equator. In order to satisfy the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition required for numerical stability, we are forced to select sufficiently small time-steps based on the minimum node spacing and characteristic ocean flow time-scale \citep{arakawa1977computational,sears1995tidal}. Such a constraint on the time step is often referred to as the ``pole problem''. Several workarounds to ease the time step have been applied throughout the literature \citep{comblen2009finite}. For example, it is common to apply a Fourier filter to remove high wavenumber components of the solvable fields near the poles \citep{murray2002fourier}, or to use the spectral transform method as reviewed by \citet{swarztrauber1996spectral}. In this work, however, we apply none of these methods, and obey the CFL condition by selecting the appropriate time step for the model resolution.

\begin{figure}[!b]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/CoordProb}
\caption{Schematic representation of the ocean tide due to the eccentricity-radial tidal potential ($U_{20}$), at periapsis. Taking the derivative of $v$ across the north pole yields a null result in the spherical coordinate system, despite the clear mass divergence away from the poles leading to $\eta < 0$.\label{fig:coord_prob}}
\end{figure}

A more significant issue arises from the combined choice of coordinate system and grid structure. Nodes located directly at the poles become singularities in space, as the normal directions east and west used to define the velocity components become meaningless. Consider the northward velocity flow near the north pole under the eccentricity-radial tide, shown in Figure \ref{fig:coord_prob}. Conservation of mass and the formation of an equatorial bulge force flow to diverge away from the pole. In solving for the surface displacement node directly at $\lambda = 90^{\circ}$, we must take the derivative of $v$ across the pole (as in Equation \ref{eq:momv_fd}). As each $v$ node located either side of the pole has the same magnitude and, perhaps unintuitively, is orientated in the same direction (southwards), this derivative becomes zero.  This forces surface displacement at the pole to zero as well. Yet, as there is divergence away from the pole, it is required that $\eta < 0$ to conserve mass. Clearly, the choice of coordinate system and grid do not permit such behaviour at the poles. %Longitudinal symmetry in $u$ causes the $u$ derivative from Equation \ref{eq:momu_fd} to be also zero.

To work around this problem, we employ both first-order accurate one dimensional Euler interpolation and third-order accurate Lagrange interpolation for all $u$ and $\eta$ nodes located at the pole, avoiding the need to directly solve for these points. We then take the mean of the interpolated $\eta$ points and prescribe that as the polar value. For $u$, the mean is taken for the eccentricity tide as eastward velocity tends towards zero at the poles. Average velocity is not computed for the obliquity tide, however, as non-zero eastward velocity components exist at the poles.

\subsection{Model Runs and Parameters \label{subsec:param}}

\input{./param_table.tex}

%All numerical results presented in the following section are for surface oceans on Titan and Enceladus. Titan is an appropriate benchmark for our numerical model because, as already discussed, much of the numerical scheme used in this work is described by \citet{sears1995tidal} who applied his model to Titan.

We first perform both semi-analytical and numerical simulations for Titan and Enceladus under the eccentricity and obliquity tides. For each tidal component over 3000 simulations were run for \hbox{$h = 1 - 10^4 \, \si{\metre}$} and \hbox{$\alpha = 10^{-9} - 10^{-5} \, \si{\per\second}$}. Such resolution is necessary to capture resonant features. The semi-analytical solution for the time averaged surface heat flux was directly compared to the numerical values to reveal any inaccuracies in the numerical solution across this parameter space. 

Following testing and verification of the numerical solutions for Rayleigh drag, ODIS was then run using only bottom drag for \hbox{$h = 1 - 10^4 \, \si{\metre}$} and \hbox{$c_D = 10^{-7} - 10^{-1}$}. These simulations were again run for both the eccentricity and obliquity tides. With results for both Rayleigh and bottom drag we were able to compare tidal dissipation between these two drag models. The model parameters used for both Titan and Enceladus are shown in Table \ref{tb:param}.

Numerically solving the LTEs to convergence is a computationally expensive process. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:conv_a}, convergence will only be reached after a significant amount of simulation time. The example given in Figure \ref{fig:conv_a} was run using initial conditions for a stationary, undisturbed ocean. To speed up convergence we employ the technique used by \citet{sears1995tidal}, whereby the final output of one simulation is used as the initial condition for the next simulation. Upon completion, each simulation will spawn one to two `child' simulations. These new processes will in turn spawn their own `children' once they are complete. This method of solving over such a large parameter space helps to significantly reduce computational run time. Several tests were also run to ensure that a given simulation would converge to a single solution, regardless of initial condition.
