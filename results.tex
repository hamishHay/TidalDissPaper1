\section{Results - Titan \label{sec:results_Titan}}

The following results are split into three main sections. We firstly present specific solutions to the LTEs for a global surface ocean on Titan using Rayleigh friction. We then compare dissipation between the analytical and numerical solutions in section \ref{subsubsec:linTitan}. Section \ref{subsec:botTitan} then presents purely numerical results for dissipation using only bottom friction. These results are then repeated for Enceladus in section \ref{sec:results_Enceladus}.

\subsection{Rayleigh Friction}

\subsubsection{LTE Solutions}

Figure \ref{fig:LTE_solns} illustrates numerical solutions to the LTE, at periapse, for different components of the tidal potential on Titan. Surface displacement, $\eta$, is illustrated on the left, whereas velocity, $\bm{u}$, is on the right. The colour scale in the velocity figures represents the velocity's magnitude, $\left| \bm{u} \right|$. Arrows indicate the direction of flow. The tidal forcing applied is, from a) to c), the eccentricity tide, obliquity tide, and full tide, respectively. All plots are for the ``canonical'' $400 \, \si{\metre}$ ocean used by \citet{sagan1982tide} for best comparison with \citet{sears1994tidal,sears1995tidal,sohl1995tidal}.

Surface displacement in Figure \ref{fig:LTE_a} shows a classic tidal bulge, centered on the Saturnian ($\phi = 0^{\circ}$) and sub-Saturian ($\phi = 180^{\circ}$) points. Maximum displacement is over $8$ metres. Away from the tidal bulge, displacement drops below the equilibrium level to less than $4$ metres. The corresponding flow shows convergence and divergence at the longitudinal positions of steepest gradient in the displacement field. Fastest flow occurs at the maxima and minima of the displacement.

\label{fig:linTitan}
\end{figure*}

The obliquity tide shows markedly different displacement and flow patterns than the eccentricity tide (Figure \ref{fig:LTE_b}). Displacement is now anti-symmetric about the equator. Notably, the longitudinal positions of maxima and minima are offset from the Saturnian and sub-Saturnian points. The tide raised by the obliquity tidal potential is also an order of magnitude less than the eccentricity tide. Flow is mainly poleward, converging south of the equator on the Saturn-facing hemisphere, and north of the equator on the opposite hemisphere.

The final plot in figure \ref{fig:LTE_solns} is the solution under the full tidal potential. In many ways it is similar to the eccentricity tide. Yet, the addition of the obliquity tide adds a degree of equatorial asymmetry to the solutions. This asymmetry is particularly noticeable in the velocity plot on the right hand side of Figure \ref{fig:LTE_c}, where the areas of fastest flow are skewed north and south of the equator, unlike in Figure \ref{fig:LTE_a}. This is also evident in the displacement field, where the highest tide is offset from the equator.

These simulations were run from undisturbed initial conditions: \hbox{$\eta = 0 \, \si{\metre}$} and \hbox{$\bm{u} = (0,0) \, \si{\metre\per\second}$}. Consequently, there was some start-up time required for the model to converge into its orbitally-averaged equilibrium, as noted by \citet{sears1995tidal}. Figure \ref{fig:conv_a} illustrates this type of behaviour.



\subsubsection{Tidal Dissipation \label{subsubsec:linTitan}}

Dissipated surface heat flux averaged over the tidal period was calculated for over 3000 simulations using equations \ref{eq:E_alpha} and \ref{eq:E_alpha_orbit}. These simulations were performed for a range of $h$ and $\alpha$ values for each main tidal component, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:linTitan}. The eccentricity tide (Figure \ref{fig:lincEccTitan}) shows three resonant dissipative ocean thicknesses, $h \sim$ \SIlist{2;3;22}{\metre}. These horizontal resonances are the result of excited gravity waves, with the deepest of these having a maximum dissipated surface heat flux of $\sim 10\, \si{\watt\per\square\metre}$ which occurs between $\alpha =$ \SIrange{e-8}{e-7}{\per\second}. Notably, the maximum dissipated energy does not occur for the most friction dominated oceans where $\alpha \sim \num{e-5} \, \si{\per\second}$.

\caption{Global ocean surface dissipation solution for Titan under the eccentricity (left) and obliquity (right) tides. The logarithm of dissipated energy is shown as function of ocean depth, $h$, and coefficient of bottom friction, $c_D$. All simulations were performed with \SIrange{1}{3}{\degree} resolution. \label{fig:botTitan}}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:lincEccTitan} illustrates the dissipated surface heat flux for the obliquity tide on Titan. Two resonant ocean thicknesses are found for this tidal component, $h \sim$ \SIlist{1;10}{\metre}. The latter resonance is the most dissipative with an average surface heat flux of $\sim \num{4e-3}\, \si{\watt\per\square\metre}$. There is also a slanted resonance that appears from $h \sim$ \SIrange{10}{e4}{\metre} and \hbox{$\alpha \sim$ \SIrange{e-6}{e-9}{\per\second}}. The average surface heat flux occurring along the length of this resonance is $\sim \num{1e-4}\, \si{\watt\per\square\metre}$. 

Numerical error was also computed using the analytical solutions. The eccentricity tide is accurate to within 1\% over much of the parameter space, with resonances being the least accurate (in terms of absolute value). The deepest resonance differs from the analytical solution by \SIrange{1}{20}{\percent}. We ignore discrepancies in shallow oceans ($h_0 \leq 10 \, \si{\metre}$); bathymetry of the ocean floor for any icy satellite will likely be comparable to or exceed the depth of the ocean, directly violating the assumptions made in the LTEs. It should also be noted that resonances found below $h_0 = 10 \, \si{\metre}$ typical have $\text{min} (\eta) < - h_0$, also violating the LTEs. As such, we deem this part of the parameter space unphysical.

\subsection{Bottom Friction \label{subsec:botTitan}}

Dissipation across $h$ and $c_D$ space (bottom friction) is shown in Figure \ref{fig:botTitan}, again calculated using equations \ref{eq:E_cd} and \ref{eq:E_cd_orbit}. Tidal dissipation due to the eccentricity tide is shown in the left hand figure. Comparing this to Rayleigh dissipation in Figure \ref{fig:lincEccTitan} highlights some of the major differences and similarities between the two friction regimes. The resonant peaks at \SIlist{2;3;22}{\metre} from the Rayleigh friction case are all present, although they have smaller magnitudes. The resonance broadens towards larger $c_D$, and remains very diffuse over much of the parameter space. This differs from the Rayleigh friction case where the resonances is very narrow and pronounced over most of $\alpha$ space (Figure \ref{fig:lincEccTitan}). Additionally, away from the resonances and in the deepest oceans, dissipated energy drops by \numrange{10}{12} orders of magnitude when applying bottom friction, which is far smaller than the lowest dissipation found in the Rayleigh friction case.  

Ocean dissipation under the obliquity tide using bottom friction also has several important differences to the Rayleigh friction case. Comparing figures \ref{fig:botObliqTitan} and \ref{fig:linObliqTitan}, it is again evident that the horizontal gravity wave resonances at \SIlist{1;10}{\metre} are still present when using bottom friction. These resonances rapidly broaden towards higher $c_D$, when bottom drag becomes more dominant. Perhaps the most significant difference between each case is the orientation of the broad resonance that extends to the deepest oceans. In the Rayleigh case, this resonance moves diagonally across a large region of the parameter space, whereas it is vertically oriented and limited to a small range of $c_D$ for bottom friction. The resonance also happens to occur across the empirically derived Earth value for $c_D = 0.002$ \citep[e.g.,][]{sohl1995tidal,egbert2001estimates}.

\subsection{Comparison with Scaling Laws \label{subsec:scalTitan}}

While there are no fully analytical solutions to the LTEs when including bottom friction, there are a set of scaling laws for estimating dissipation that neglect resonant features, developed by \citet{chen2013tidal}. We compare cross sections from the ODIS results in Figure \ref{fig:botTitan} with these scaling laws, shown in Figure \ref{fig:scalTitan}.

\caption{Comparison of the ODIS numerical results (solid lines) and those calculated using the scaling laws (dashed lines) derived in \citet{chen2013tidal}, for Titan. There is excellent agreement between the two results for deep oceans and away from resonances. \label{fig:scalTitan}}
\end{figure*}

Away from resonances and in deep oceans, there is excellent agreement between the numerical ODIS results and the scaling laws. This is particularly true of the eccentricity tide. Larger discrepancies are found for the obliquity tide (Figure \ref{fig:scalObliqTitan}) in deep oceans, but this is a result of discretisation error. The vertically orientated resonant feature in Figure \ref{fig:botObliqTitan} is also recreated in the scaling laws shown in Figure \ref{fig:scalObliqTitan}. None of the gravity wave resonances are captured by the scaling laws. 

\subsection{Implications for Titan}

Titan likely has an ocean that is several hundred kilometres thick \citep{sohl2003interior}. All of the eccentricity tide resonances fall in oceans much more shallow than this, suggesting that - despite the substantial free eccentricity - there is little contribution from this tidal component to heating Titan's ocean.

Rossby wave resonances from the obliquity tide appear as the diagonal and vertical features in figures \ref{fig:linObliqTitan} and \ref{fig:botObliqTitan}, respectively. The linear friction resonance moves into unrealistically low coefficients of friction ($\alpha \lesssim$ \SI{e-9}{\per\second}) for oceans deeper than about \SI{10}{\kilo\metre}. However, for bottom friction, the Rossby wave resonance is mainly independent of ocean depth above $h \gtrsim$ \SI{100}{\metre}. If Titan's ocean fell within the $c_D =$ \SIrange{e-2}{e-4} range then this Rossby wave resonance could provide a non-neglible thermal energy component to Titan's interior, regardless of the ocean depth. Unfortunately, $c_D$ is an unknown parameter on Titan and there is no reason to suggest it is similar to Earth's value of \num{0.002}, which happens to fall near the center of this resonance (Figure \ref{fig:botObliqTitan}).
